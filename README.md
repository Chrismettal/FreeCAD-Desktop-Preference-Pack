# FreeCAD Desktop preference pack

My preferences for FreeCAD on desktop environments. Mostly for myself to carry my settings between machines.

Updates the vast majority of graphical, performance and user input settings. If you try to use this on your machine, be sure to backup your user.cfg!


## Installation

Symlink cloned repo into destination, or add this repo as an additional addon manager source
